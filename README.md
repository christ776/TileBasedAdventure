==================

My first attempt to create a (sort of) RPG game using Cocos2D.

Hi, I'm Christian De Martino, and I'm learning Cocos2D, because I always wanted to create games :) and what better tool
than using iOS and Coco2D as a framework !

While this is a *very* rough game, I do hope to flesh it out and have something I can be proud of. In the meantime, I'd
like other developers to find this code useful . 

Last but not least, this code is based on the excelent tutorial at Ray Wenderlich site.

thanks, and happy coding !
